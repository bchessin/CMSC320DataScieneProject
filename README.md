This is a research project I did with two other collegaues while at the University of Maryland. In order to view the project, please click on the .ipynb file and it will show all the work. This project is coded entirely in Python.

The idea is that we scraped data using Google's BigQuery and then did analysis on a NOAA data set. We also used external libraries such as MatPlotlib, mstats, Pandas. We also wrote a custom machine learning algorithm towards the end of the project.

It's pretty cool check it out!

It was originally written in Jupyter's Notebooks / Python.
