This is a CMSC320 Project I did with two other people while at the University of Maryland. In order to view the project, please click on the .ipynb file and it will show all the work.

The idea is that we scraped data using Google's BigQuery and then did analysis on a NOAA data set. It's pretty cool check it out!

It was originally written in Jupyter's Notebooks / Python.
